some time next year . We haven't set the date yet .
Well . You can trust me this time . My sister is definitely sick . I'm just coming from the hospital . They say she might even die .
Excuse me , i am a new student here . Could you tell me where the English Department is ?
Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible .
I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time .
What happens if I use up my sick days before the end of the year ? If I ' m sick an extra day or two , will my pay be deducted ?
Would you pour me some of that tea , please ?
If you're lucky , that might do the trick .
You should be , because you ' re a part of history .
I really love how rain clears the air .
Hello , is that Cathy speaking ?
Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus .
I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater , and it should be tight .
Oh , I don ' t know where we ' re going yet .
I am not exaggerating at all . I ' m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time .
But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with .
Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ?
I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour . There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out .
Yes , sir . I ' ll get them for you right away . Would you please sign this bill first ? Thank you , sir .
Not yet . I don't know how to fill out the form . What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ?
I'm Akimbo . Nice to meet you , I guess .
I've never gotten one . Have you ?
Sure . But it's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow .
Yes that ' s right . I ' Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ' m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically .
My name is Liu Lichi . How do you do ?
Could you sign each cheque here for me ?
Well , sir , I think I have made a mistake . I will take it back to the kitchen right now .
Could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from Dr . Miller ?
You really should go to Rachel's pet store .

First of all , we need to understand what I was looking for . Do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ?
but you look quite proficient in using them now .
Well , it depends on the price , of course . What is it ?
Because I have given him up as a bad job . Our relation has been over .
Eggs , milk , bread . Things like that .

She sure can . Are you jealous , Leslie ?
Are these the clothes you want to have washed ?
I've taken courses on office administration , reports and correspondence writing . I think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager , because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
You don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work .
No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them .
Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response to any click .
Have you had any working experience .
Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky !
Are you interested in watching it ?
I've gotten chow mein from there before .
The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ?
Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ?
Yes . You can also enjoy legal holidays and year-end bonus .
Yes . We ' Ve taken care of all of that . We decided not to get married in a church though . Neither of us is very religious .
What time does the train for Tibet leave ?
Well , she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today .
Of course ! I can watch them without you !
Tonight ? I'm afraid I can't . I've promised Mark to go to the gym . Can we make it tomorrow ?
Yeah , yeah . Anyway ... I'm packed . Are you ?
That's excellent . How have you managed that ?
I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward . It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive .
You can ' t possibly know in advance how much you will be working . If you mail it in too soon , we will reject it !
That means that you talk to them ? In which language ?
I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not .
It ' s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .
Can you direct me to Holiday inn ?
It surely is . And the cast is really the best .
Those are the only things you eat ?
Here's your Passbook back and the receipt to say we confiscated the 500 RIB worth of counterfeit notes .

I live in my uncle's house . He came here ten years ago .
I would like that . Thank you .
Ha , I know Cheng Long a lot , he has made 40 films since 1976 . And at that time he was promoted as the new Bruce Lee . But I'm not familiar with his English name .
How do you feel about that restaurant ?
Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ?
Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway .
Yes . Could you tell many balance ? Here's account number .
They got me a part-time tutoring job , teaching an Australian businessman Chinese .
It ' s OK . Where should I pay for the penalty ?
No , I think Harry will get it .
No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars .
Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already .
What a pity ! You can't join us .
Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .
Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ?
No problem , sir . Everything will be ready when you come back .
Well , I ' ll be glad to help you out . I can come out anytime on Tuesday or Thursday of next week .
Then it is June 20 the day after tomorrow .
Sure . That ' s really nice of you . Let ' s go in and try some things on .

Hearing you say that is a big reward for us . And here is the receipt .

I know , but geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field .
Just that in effect , a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds .
That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much .
Is there some way I can get into contact with him ?
Little dude , your life is over !
I am afraid not . Are there any vacant tables ?
Are you staying at the Hilton ?
Which season do you like best ?
Sorry , I am not sure , can I take a message ?
Of course . A two-week paid vacation a year , a five-day workweek .
Easter's a good day for reunions . The family goes to church together .
I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad .
The stepmother was very wicked . She couldn't stand a happy smile on the boy's face .
Will you make some recommendation ?
ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great .
Don ' t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts .
Do you have experience in advertising ?
Later we'll let you know who the King and Queen of the Reunion will be .
Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ?
I'll give you a blood test . Would you roll up your sleeve ? Just as I thought . You're anemic . You'd better pay more attention to your diet . Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . And don't stay up late working . Try to get more rest .
Right , I see . Let me give you another 500 RIB .
Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating .
Whatever . Just make sure you go vote .

Yeah , you ' re right . We aren ' t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures .

I wear size 36 . This pair looks nice . Can I try them on ?
Paris is a beautiful city . I have never been there . Have you ever been there , Ken ?
I guess we'll see just around .
What does it say ? Do you think he'll see it ?
Uh ... Yeah ! I ' Ve told you a thousand times that I ' m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band .
hi , Bob , I am so glad that you came .
Is classical music your favorite ?
No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO -- the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased .
Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - '

Hi , Mr . Smith . what's new ?
What kinds of currency do you change ?

I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process .
Do you have something to read ?
Tomato or orange juice , please .
What's wrong with Debbie today ? She seems upset about something .
You have to make an appointment first .
The best way to reach him is by cell phone . I'll give you his number .
It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?
Let's get frozen juice . It is really good . We ' Ve got enough food . Let ' s go over to the check-out stand .
We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet !
Not yet . They were holding two men in Ohio , but they let them go . They weren ' t the criminals after all .
Do you know what kind of flowers she likes ?

What if I don't want to find another girl ?
Oh , there are 5000 seats in total .
I get home pretty late , around midnight .
What about water pollution instead of pollution ?
Let's see , sir . According to your file , you watched ' Titanic ' Monday evening .
Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume .
Maybe just a quick sandwich , salad , or something .
The master suite is the best . Let ' s go look at that next .
Would you like another bigger one ?
He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
What kind of pie do you want ?
Yeah , she's hot . Radiator's leaking . Looks like you were running her pretty hard .
No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?
Don't be so angry . It's passed anyway .
well , they ' Ve got the money and she ' s going tomorrow for treatment .
That ' s all right . We ' ll teach you .
Can you operate computers skillfully ?
So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them .
Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion .
All right , just a quick one .
Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes .
Don't you have your own parking spot ?
I think that's just steam . Your engine's overheated .
Whew ! I had to wait for almost an hour to get to the front of the line .
A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart , and it ' s messing up the room .
I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round .
Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .
And it ' s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ' s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her .
That's a good idea . And remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings .
Obviously I look for improvement as we go along , but I would like you to do your best from the beginning .
What would you like to have for dinner ? Chicken or beef ?
Put your luggage on the scale , please . Oh , your luggage is overweight .
Wonderful ! Do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room ?
That's not the way to solve the problem . Did you look in the classified advertisements column ?
That ' s not going to be all right .
Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice .
I know for sure that something is wrong !
Thank you very much for your kindness .
What kind of gas does this car take ?
That sounds absolutely fantastic .
Good idea . A network of work stations is helpful for our management .
I'll have another cup of beer insist . I know I don't like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me .
Would you like to have some more beer ?
I would like to report a break-in .
Actually , fruits and veggies are really good for you .
Can I see your passbook and the withdrawal slip , please ?
Then I'll come to your place later in the evening , and how late is your shop open ?
That would be great ! Give me a call !
Sorry , it's not available now . Anything else ?
And I can purchase that here ?
I give up ! I simply can't learn French !
In foreign trade , exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner .
Did you hear about the robbery ?
Do you have any dutiable items ?
I don't understand why I need to make an appointment .
Why don't you watch where you're going ?
me , too . Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ?
Oh , yes . That would be lovely .
Scrambled egg , bacon , three pieces of bread and a cup of tea .
As long as we ' re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time .
for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense .
Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher .
Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage .
I don't know . It's a rental .
what do you think about abortion ?
Thank you . And when is the latest time for me to board the plane ?
Would you please show me that mural ?
I am sorry . The flight is late . Please go to the waiting room for further notice .
It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks .
Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !
All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up .
Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD .
Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call .
Not to me , I wouldn't be caught dead in that .
You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic .
What ' s going to be covered in the orientation ?
It sounds great . I'll take it .
That is great . Do you have to work the night shift ?
Yeah . They simply had no extra money to save up or for other things .
I'm not sure , but I don't think she's given out that many .
do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?
But I think Henry is a backroom boy . He always helps her with her study .
Excuse me , could you give me change for a dollar ?
Let me see . The bell-bottom pants are $ 90 and the coat is $ 120 . It comes to $ 210 .
Well , I go to the gym a lot . I am a member of a gym nearby .
My father lives in Washington DC .
Right . I enjoy what I'm doing .
At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ?
Susan is going to get a divorce .
I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars .
Trust me , the food isn't half bad .
Well , why don't you go on the diet ?
What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable .
OK , wait for a moment . Well , I am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . In this case , you'd better change 2,000 $ to Swiss francs .
We'd better take it up with them , in that case .
I think that she is very pretty .
Would you like those with yogurt ?
Well , this is my baggage claim tag . Can you get my baggage now ?
Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane .
I'm sorry we won't . You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful .
I ' m afraid I ' m a poor talker . I ' m not comfortable talking with the people whom I have just met for the first time . That is not very good for business , so I have been studying public speaking .
Yes , I ' m pleased to see that you also got a distinction .
Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy .
I am great ! How about you , Mary ? How are you ?
I had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won ' t be able to come to school today .
Yes , I pretty much understand the company .
It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture .
Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me .
I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side .
Yes , I like travelling . I am young , and unmarried . It ' s no problem for me to travel frequently .
Nice to meet you too ! I am Peter Smith .
Is the current asking price listed on the flyer ?
Are you telling me that you've seen her before ?
Hey Tina . What are you doing ?
This is Bill Burton from Milford Insurance , I'm calling in regards to our meeting next Tuesday .
We would like to start you off at 1,500 yuan a month , not including bonus and overtime pay . We don ' t give bonus every month , but we offer a semi-annual bonus . And you will receive two weeks paid vacation a year , as well . Does it suit you ?
Yes . Now we are in the Olympic stadium , the center of this park .
Please note that this ticket has a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation .
I think I forgot to send it in !
That ' s out of the question .
No , we ' re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately .
We ' Ve been looking around for many hours . What on earth are you looking for ?
But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .
I will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem .
Right . Ok , the fare is $ 700 .
Maybe . After all , I am grown up now .
Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .
First , I ' Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story .
Ha ! That's right . You used to smoke . I forgot !
Good afternoon . what can I do for you ?
I am sorry . It's a one-price shop .

Perhaps one year , I'm not sure .
It looks so beautiful . How much is it ?
Oh , come on ! The game is better with three people . Anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad .
We don't use any fossil fuels . Most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants . We're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power .
Do you do the same exercises every day ?
No appetite , always on edge , and I can't sleep well .
Yes , sometimes the differences are great .
Sorry again for bothering you .
Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .
I was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria .
I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here .
I think I ' m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ?
OK . What's the reason you are sending her flowers ?
No , thank you . Check , please .
How do you think they could be ended ?
So , it has a history for more than a decade ?
I hate doing the damn laundry .
You'll need to wait a few minutes for the fries . They are still in the fryer .
It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult .
no , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend .
I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself .

Thank you . I ' m pleased to meet you , Mr . Brown . My name is Kathy Pewless , the representative of Green Textile Import and Export Corporation .
It ' s a traditional Scottish delicacy , you take sheep ' s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ' s stomach .

I'm very sorry , sir . I could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel .
I didn ' t realize that speaking in class could be so easy .
In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time .
Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .
I would also like a bag of chips .
Sure . When do you want to take the plane ?
Oooh ! One for each of the zeros in 2000 ! Wow !
What is the qualification needed by the position ?
Oh , yes . The nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what I could drink . In the end , I just drank water and nothing else . Everyone was very professional and I actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay .
It's too small for me to wear .
My roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus . They stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while I have no place for study . I even don't have the quietness to sleep .
Oh , I much prefer to go by car , then we don't need to get to the station with our luggage and ...

I'm going to go shopping for groceries in a little bit .

But our credit card saves you 10 percent .
OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night .
How long does it take you to cook a meal for 5 or 6 people ?
I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself I think . A friend in need is a friend in deed . The more really close friends I have , the better .
Anyway , how was your such , Catherine ?
Hello , the nurse said that you might have my test results in from the other day .
Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house .
What kinds of parades are there ?
I know . I wonder what's keeping him .
I think you look fantastic . Happy Birthday !
The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ?
Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary .
Ahahah , Maybe that will help you lose weight .
Would you like to reserve a private dining room ?
Oh , okay . Can I do that right now ?
It is RIB 10 yuan initially and 2 yuan for each kilometer .
Yes , please . We're on our way out , so we put the ' make up ' sign on . Could you bring us some towels and hangers ?
Are you sure you can't lend me five thousand dollars ?
Yes , madam ? Can I help you ?
I have puzzled my brain about how to teach the children .
That would be lovely , thanks .
that's ok . I'll wait until you're finished . Just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ?
I'm not sure . I know I should know that , but I can't remember right now .
Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow .
Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house .
Not yet , I pick it up tomorrow .
Thank you . I'm sure you will .
And I'm glad to meet you , too .
My parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
It's Beethoven . Do you like it ?
I have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate . May I ask why I was defeated ?
This home is gorgeous on the inside !
Let me see . Laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture lotion , ... Oh , that is too much . You are not going to a business trip .
I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel .
And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help .
Look at the show on TV . I am watching a food show at a very famous seafood restaurant . I really want to eat at that restaurant . I am a seafood lover .
It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ?
Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ?
Well , unfortunately I have got something to do this weekend . But let me see ...
I just wanted to give you the good news .
Yes , please . I ' m Mr . Peter , the Director of Personnel . What can I do for you ?
I ran my car into a tree yesterday and need to miss a few days of school .
Honey , I have something important to say .
Yes . We had planned to marry on June 20 , but something happened , so we had to put off our wedding day .
It really does , I can't wait .
Yes , please . Do you have any carry-on items ?
You mean you haven ' t arranged any car ?
Great ! Can you set the table ?
Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ' t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . For example , never handle a weapon that you haven ' t inspected yourself . Always make sure there isn ' t anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot !
Well , I don't want it then . Can I move to another pump ?
Here's the swimming pool . It's open from 10 a . m . to 11 p . m . There are also massage rooms here .
What makes you think there was a break-in ?
We expect the usher girl to be good-looking , no less than 165 centimeters high , and love smiling .
You guys are charging me $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw .

Have you received any honors ?
This looks wonderful , Madame Culot .
What is your favorite color , miss ?
At school . And I'm still learning it now .
The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening .
I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding .
oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip .
Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate .
His grandfather's money is not his .
Oh , yeah , It ' s quite of variety . Regular , cold perm , straight perm , pink curl and form .
Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up .
It's very nice . There are only four people , and those girls are very kind and friendly .
Sure . The coach leaves at 6:30 a . m . , in front of our office . The drive takes eight hours , with two stops to see some sights .
Five o ' clock that afternoon , and in my place , you know ?
The bartender just gave the last call . Let's order another round , okay ?
Yes , but I have never taken his class before .
Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away .
Yeah . I totally forgot they were due .
What ? Are you serious ? You'd defect to our archrival ! ?
I don't really like seeing bloody frames , but I appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects .
Yes . I'd like a cup of onion soup .
Do you have any seats for September 16th ?
You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized .
Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names .
Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?
I firmly believe that you love your brother very much .
Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already .
Some are better than others . But , you shouldn't have a problem .
Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money .
Oh hello , Sally . This is Dave Thomson here . Could I speak to Jim please ?
Your discount is already included . Normally we charge ¥ 400 , but now we can give you a special price . This is our sale period .
Yes , Of course . What's your telephone number ?
Oh , it looks well . I like it very much .
Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?
You can place the smaller one in the overhead bin and put the bigger one under the seat in front of you .
I'll be with you in a minute .
Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ?
How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
Actually I ' m buying a camera for my husband .
Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended .
The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same .
To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
If that happen to me , I ' ll take them back to the shop .
Everything is fine , and how are you ?
It ' s about as complicated as chess . The basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn .
Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class .
What working experience have you get ?
I need to book a plane ticket to London .
Yesterday I had a quarrel with my roommate . I'm really fed up with all this .
I really wanted you to come , but I understand .
Yes , I think I can in ordinary circumstances .
Well , I swim and run every day .
I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over .
Sure . First of all , it ' s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ' t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic .
They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you .
What happened ? Why didn't he win ?
Thank you . Also , we'd like to do some sightseeing while we're in town . Can you recommend some local attractions ?
It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy .
Yes . Tell him Mr . Cook called and ask him to return my call soon as he gets back .
It is our 10th wedding anniversary this June 20 .
Yes , of course . You would be responsible for the development of software products .
Have you any round-neck sweater ?
I'm from America . Are you settling in all right ?
Why not ? It is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking .
That means it will get hotter .
excuse me , could you tell me which line I ' m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ?
Dave , there's something I want to talk to you about .
How about you and Tom ? What time is your wedding ?
I really like your books . I ' Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !
That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with .
Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer .
Will this table be all right ?
Yes . That's the company policy .
Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together , don't you think ?
How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Ms . Smith . I ' m Jack Stevens from the Marketing Department . Here is my card .
really impressive . These two genres are totally different .
I need at least 75,000 per year .
May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ?
Yeah , this place looks great . Wow , look at her , she can certainly get down , can't she ?
You might think this strange , but I like the category for best foreign language film .
Certainly , Madam . What would you like to know ?
I'm sorry to hear that . I'm afraid it is often the case during the peak hours . Shall I ask them to call you when the line is free ?
You just can ' t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding !
Good morning . what can I do for you ?
That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ' s really annoying !
I don't know if anything terrible has happened .
Good . I don't want to leave Beijing without visiting it .
I majored in Public Relations .
If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude .
I ' m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that .
OK . Do you have anything to declare ?
Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem .
The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest .
Has your company been affected much by government legislation ?
I ' m a little nervous . I ' Ve never flown before .
Yes , what do you want to know ?
I ' m calling to cancel my reservation for Trans Pacific Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis . Could you please make it for the same flight on August 2 instead of July 19 ?
Can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ?
Really ? I'II take it and I'm leaving here tomorrow . Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you get it in ?
I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free .
It actually costs less if you have a bus pass .
Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight . Maybe even for two nights .
Hello , Becky . Well , you see , I have this thing here , called a Fixed Deposit Certificate , and I've just noticed the date on it .
I'll certainly look into that .
Well , we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ' re not allowed to use lead in our products any more .
Can ' t you just tell me now ?
Well . No , I didn't clean it . But still , I only had the last one two months , and it broke . I don't trust auto-reverse .
Only one . But I wanted to make sure I'd get it .
How much will my pay be , if you don ' t mind my asking ?
I don't want to miss my flight .
How long should I continue taking them ?
In London . Where do you live ?
And what is the most important point ?
Goodbye . Thank you again for coming .
Sure . I strongly advise you to buy a bottle of perfume and a lighter .
I would like to buy a black suit .
I don't care . I want to burn up my fat .
Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing !
That ' s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes .
I'm sorry . It's out of stock now . Could you come by again next week ?
Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren .
Ok . Maybe you should invite your sister along , too .
I have so much house work to do . I have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends .
Let me look . Let ' s see ... they ' Ve got one in blue , green , pink , black ... and white . Here you are .
Please help yourself to whatever you like , don't be shy .
A new car . And I've got a small family , two children , and I haven't got a lot of money and ...
In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ' ll do well in those same events .
Great , have a good day , thanks again for the offer .
I was just watching a documentary on TV about how people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting .
were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ?
Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at this university ?
I'd love to , the movies are smash hit .
Not really . The credit card is a revolving account . You only pay interest on what you owe .
Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired .
Let ' s go to Chicago . We can have lunch in Chinatown . Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field !
I'd like to buy some milk powder . What would you recommend ?
Well , we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified . And he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan for your needs .
Generally speaking , a CV or resume is made up of 6 parts , personal information , educational experience , practical experience , personal skills , self-evaluation and job intentions .
I don't have any with me , but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you .
He must be green . It ' s lucky that we will get off soon .
Good morning . I ' m from the New York book review . Could I ask you some questions about your latest book ?
We're very sorry for the delay . I'll check immediately and call you back .
Absolutely . By the way , do you sell any traditional Chinese medicine ?
One moment , please , sir . ... Here's your bill . Would you like to check and see if the amount is correct ?
Do you have your library card ?
Have you decided what you ' re going to do during your holiday ?
Things are going well for me , Joe .
I have passed the CET - 4 and 6 . As far as computer is concerned I can use the computer for word processing .
But it is too loose . Do you have the smaller size ?
Yes . When I spread it out back home , I found this hole .
It looks like it may rain soon .
Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year .
How long will an investigation take ?
If you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go .
Sure , I have a friend who play fairly well . We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game .
Yeah , I will . See you then !
I'm looking for a string of pearls for my wife .
I know . I know . I'm really sorry . I lost my bag .
Really ? Have you had an auto-reverse break before ?
Yes . You've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .
Yes . I ' Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . The demand for phone cameras is growing , and Pear has been falling behind in the market .
Oh , yeah . I'm glad you mentioned that . I think we need to hire somebody new to manage it .
Excuse me , sir , but are you Mr . Richard of World Trading Company ?
Okay . Then I recommend this one . It's made especially for men about your age .
Yes . Would tomorrow morning be all right with you ?
Hello , Miao Li , Where are you going ?
I think you should be more careful next time .
This house is not looking all that great from here
Yeah , I saw that . I thought you were playing a game with them .
What course did you like best ?
There are different types . Which one do you like best ?
The asking price has recently gone down to two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars .
That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .
Got it . Thanks for reminding me . And , are there any intensive training courses ?
The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up .
Tell him I telephoned . I'd like to see him about the videotapes . Can he call me this afternoon ?
What do you think about this store ? I heard it ' s a posh store that ' s only got branches in big cities .
I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late .
Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .
Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one .
You mean I should make an appointment ahead of time ?
You're right , that is great .
Have you heard what happened ?
I don't think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts .
Yes , please tell her that band practice has been moved to Tuesday night at eight thirty .
I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .
Alright , alright . I ' m coming .
Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot .
I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr . Stone .
You can come in this afternoon . If you are feeling too stressed , feel free to bring a friend along .
great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain .
We ? The day after tomorrow ? What are you talking about ?
I need to take the driver's course . How many hours do I need ?
If you had a box made in the ' 20s , that would be nice .
certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch
You've come to the right store . We've got a beautiful and wide selection of earrings for you to choose from .
that's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ?
You know how hard I've tried to give up drinking ? I ' d be lost without you . I won ' t let you go anyway .
You're from New York , aren't you ?
All superstitious nonsense ! I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks .
Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ?
being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich .
I don't know . Can I purchase Treasury Certificates here at this counter ?
May I see your ticket and passport , PLS ?
I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ?
of course ! I really love watching football games on TV .
Some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team !
Nice to see you with us , Anne . Please make yourself at home .
OK , emergency measures . Let's throw the dishes in the trash ! Two birds with one stone ...
Sounds good . Where are we going ?
I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
Oh , my God . I can't take it any more .
Good . I was thinking that I ' d like to invite you to watch a movie . I can meet you at the cinema gate .
Thank God ! I am finished writing that service guide ! It took me forever !
I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me . How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ?
That ' s great . He ' s the best runner I ' Ve seen this season . I ' m sure he ' ll win a medal at the Olympics .
I ' m sorry . I have no idea . I haven ' t seen that for ages .
Yes , sir . I'm really so sorry about that .
I want to give our kitchen the works .
Come on , Bruce . Come on , Bruce .
I'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment .
I'm sorry . Ours is a fixed price shop and I can assure you this is the best price you can get for a mural like this .
Yes , smoking or non-smoking ?
thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet .
that was the last game before the playoffs .
I can play quite well . I have a friend who likes playing , but she ' s not very good at it . Shall I invite her to play ?
Sure . Just leave it to me . I'll finish it .
You look very well , Jimmy . You are better now , but you mustn't get up yet . You must stay in bed for another two days . The boy mustn't go to school yet , Mrs Williams . And he mustn't eat rich food .
I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us .
Did you watch the volleyball match last night ?
I always hit the snooze button , so give me two calls , one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen .
You are right . The current equipment of our offices really falls behind . Next week , you can provide me a catalogue of new equipment .
Now , have you ever thought of going by express bus ?
Here you are , Mr . Richard . This is the cream and this is the sugar . If there ' s anything else you ' d like , please don ' t hesitate to tell me .
We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ?
Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting !
no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week .
Yes . Actually our range of sweaters is the most comprehensive available .
Hello , Nancy , nice to see you .
I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator .
No . thank you . I can handle it , but thanks for the offer .
Thanks . Let ' s go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ?
Well , people from Asia to Europe all enjoy tea .
I wonder if you can change it to one size down .
What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ?
Please be careful with the suitcase , it's very heavy .
There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming .
I've studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ?
You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ?
The final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework , attendance , and quizzes total 60 percent .
Good evening , madam . Can I help you ?
sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like .
Christine , I know you ' re new here and there ' s a lot to learn , but you are going to have to learn to keep your work in better order . We can ' t afford to lose an important document .
I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days .
Any fresh food , live plants , or animals ?
Don't you think it's too bloody ?
I don't think I ever got food from the cafeteria .
I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ?
What specific duties would I perform if I am hired ?
Oh , it's nothing to speak of .
I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston . She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .
Thank you , dear . I feel better now .
Yes , I would like to reserve a room for next Monday .
Push the red button on the mike to turn it on .
This morning ! No more overtime , and no more headaches !
Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .
Let me look in the TV Guide first .
If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun .
Perhaps you should excercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class .
How was the movie last night ?
Don't worry . We'll make it back to the camp site before dark .
Well , have you ever heard of Oulong tea and compressed tea ?

What is your greatest strength ?
Wow , that sounds great ! Where are you going ?
Sure . We have a one-day trip along the river . It's quite beautiful .
I believe it happened last night .
That's fine . I'll be waiting for you .
Well , maybe I can put them in the airport storage there .
Sorry , but I've gotta run . Enjoy your food , and ring the service button if you need anything else !
Yes , I do . I have worked as a salesman for P & G Company Ltd .
That's easy . It was invented by Edison .
Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you .
For the most part , yes . If you don't feel comfortable with it , then it is best not to take one at night .
I like board games . I like chinese chess and draughts .
Fine , thank you , and how are you ?
Do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ?

Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ' t it hideous ?
For what ? Are you taking up painting ?
Yes , and I want to buy the insurance too . I think it's necessary .
That ' s not true . Dark Angel is a good show .

And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water .
My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ?
I want to change some Us dollars to cover my expense here .

Yes , but I can't find Callaway Street .
Why didn ' t we choose an office in the CBD ?

That's because you don't know the short cuts . You'll learn them after a while . I can show you the ropes .
Alright , then , with this chequing account you ' ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . Will you require overdraft protection ? There is an extra fee for that .
I have the same question . I can ' t send out mails . We ' d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately .
I don ' t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ?
We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River .

Not bad . It really is great to see you again . Where have you been ?
Excuse me , I'd like to ask you a few questions about the city .
But you should tell me you were in love with her .
Great ! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job ?
Have you ever written up a business plan before ?
The plumbing in my new apartment is not working .
Hello . Nice to see you again . I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . I hope everything ' s OK .

I don't know . I just know I've never been asked so many questions in my life .
Someone suggests that I should go to Seattle and Hawaii .

Hello , I need a new suit . I have an important interview next week , so I really need to look sharp .
Oh , I ' ll go to shanghai to practice there .
Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .
I stay at No . 115 Fucking Road .
Of course ! Make yourself at home .
Take it easy . We are going to have our own baby . You should be happy .
You should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due . If it hasn ' t been , we will still accept it .
I am tired of doing that boring work . I just repeat doing counting everyday . It's so terrible .
I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ?
I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . However , I began setting time-limits for myself .
Yes , Mr . Mason , I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry , she said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She could be with your shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ?
But you should have told me you were in love with her .
No problem . What about this carry-on ?

I'm afraid I can't . I have a dinner party at seven tonight . You see , I am going to England the day after tomorrow .

Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards .

That's great . Thank you very much .
Hello , Jack . Happy birthday !
Come on man ! I even got dope and acid ! Try some !

I guess I was asking for too much .
Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them .

Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things .
wow ! That ' s fast ! I don ' t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway .
Yes , One suitcase . I also have a carry-on bag .
What ' s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ' t belong .
How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Diane .
All the sightseeing in china is very attractive and crescive . travelling to China is very worth one . thank you so much for your guides , and I'll miss you .
What kind of permanent would you like to have ?

Allan , I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project .
You are asking the right person . Here are two very important tips . First , you need to visit no more than one site to find the best products and prices . I can recommend you some online merchants .

Indeed there are bad games . But many of them are good .
Well , his son had an accident and Bill doesn ' t have health insurance . This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn ' t look into a couple of different HMO ' s .

I would be happy to look at apartments with you .
Well , I see . And what about the vacation in our company ?
I'm having a party this Friday .
Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O ' Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ' star players .

Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ?
Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ' t shutting off properly . I could have it all finished by today if it ' s urgent .
That's great . That means I can bring my cat , Mr . Twinkles . Where is the apartment located ?
As a new-comer , you usually have five days of annual vacation . And remember you have to fill out a request form , if you want to ask for leave .

That's hilarious ! What did he say ?
It's ten after six . We ' re late . But dinner is at six thirty .
You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
Thanks . If I ' m interested , I ' ll go to the library .

I'll accompany my wife to the hospital .

The second day you take a four-hour city tour . In the afternoon you go on the famous boat cruise under the falls .
Yes , but you might have told me before .
No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park .

Sure . What do you want to find ?
OK , I'll search it for you . A moment , please .
It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough .
Another flight attendant is coming down the aisle with coffee and tea .

I recommend you the white wine . It will wake up your appetite .
It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day .
I should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . Do you have any suggestion in mind ? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable .
well , I spend a lot of time watching movies .
Fine . They look nice . I will take both of them .

That's easy . It was your office ergonomics that decided me .
That's wonderful ! I like swimming .
Cool ! Also amongst the winners is Petra , in Jordan , Mach Pitch in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico .

Well , tell me something of yourself .
Yes , maybe it does . But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?
Welcome . What can I do for you , Madam ?
You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down .
Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !

How long will you stay in New York ?
You went out and bought khakis , too !
The master suite is supposed to be quite elegant . Maybe it will be a little better .
Excuse me , Sir , do you know what time it is ?
I'II take them . Please wrap them up tor me and give me the receipt .
What time is our connecting flight ?
I know . It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate .
I know . But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow . I work really hard .
Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them .
Maybe you should start seeing someone else .
And English is very useful in your job .

Really ? What did you get one for ?
Well , come over and talk to me then .
Good morning , sir . Can I help you ?
Yes , I'm hungry . What types of food sound good ?
Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well .
I wish I was free that night . I'm kind of mad that I didn't go .
For detailed information , however , you should read a history book .
Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy .
Why do you say so ? Everyone admires that you have a good wife .
We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us .
That's too bad . How much is a new one ?
Did you watch the volleyball match last night ?
I plan to , but what day is the election ?
I beg your pardon ? Who ' s climbing the tree .
Hey , did you hear about Jessica's party this weekend ?
And how long do you you plan to remain in the United States ?

It says it's located in the suburbs .
It's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it .
Well , what ' s the weather report ?
Come on , baby . It ' s time now .
Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
Absolutely . Oh , do you see a sign there ?
Please call me Jack . Have a seat , please .
I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . Maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position .

You were lucky then . What did you do after that ?
I'll call the lost and found office .
I don't know . Something rotten here ?
Quite a lot . All them one afternoon ?
Oh , yes . I had a look yesterday . I found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I ' Ve gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I ' Ve got some idea of your exports . I ' m interested in your silk blouses .
In my opinion , there are several places you mustn't miss , like Washington D . C , Las Vegas , New York and Los Angeles .
but surely they won't fire you ! You're one of the most experienced managers here !
It's more violent than TV news !
Margaret , I'd like to follow up with the arrangements for our company retreat , to take place next month . We need to book the venue , make arrangements for speakers and door prizes , and set up all the activities and accommodations . Also , very important , we need to determine which of our staff will be eligible and will be available to go . We've got to get a head count in order to make reservations .
What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?

Chinese people don't like to eat cold food .
Yes , Ms . Reese . I remember , you spoke with me . Is there a problem ?
Mr . Carter has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Shangri-La Hotel at 7:00 this evening . Here's an invitation for you .
when are you getting married ?
Does your husband feel the same ?
Let me guess , from Sarah . It looks like something she would drive .
I sometimes played table tennis and sometimes played basketball .
First of all , we'll design a custom-made work-out plan according to your habits .
That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount .
I like sports very much . Besides that , I also like working on a computer in my spare time .
Yes , we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures .
These roses should make your wife very happy .

Don't worry , young man . Lat me give you an examination . First let me take a look at your throat . Open your mouth and say'ah ' .
Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall .
No idea . Your guess is as good as mine .
I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .
It seems that ' clothes make the man ' .
I can't believe how hot it is .
But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company .
How long have you been learning it ?
Can we have a table for three , please ?
Good morning . May I help you ?
Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend .
Oh , well , how many people has she given invites to so far ?
you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .
And what's the cause of that ?
Yeah , you seem to like those styles .
You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range .
That's right . Seeing is believing .
You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ' m sure he ' s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ' t he call ?
You surely know a lot about Chinese tea .
Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job .
Wasn't that football game great ! I just knew we'd win !
How about the new bar across the road ?
Do you have maps of downtown area ?
I think someone is stalking me .

What does your mother do , may I ask ?
I didn ' t receive an unemployment check this week and need to know why .
I ' d like to make a reservation for my trip from Detroit to Beijing on April 13 on Trans Pacific Airline .
Sarah , you don't look so good . What's the matter ?
I am happy to be speaking to a presidential candidate .
Sir , we are terribly sorry for that . We will refund the charge and send your laundry to your room 3 hours later . Is that all right ?
Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ?

The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ?
Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to !

I don't really . I just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . This place is full of it .
He is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade . Are you willing to study hard ?
Room 202 , but I'm afraid we have to ask for a deposit of $ 200 .
Do you want a single ticket or a round trip ticket ?
Mam , another minute , could I ?
Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t

That would be very nice . Thank you .
Good morning , sir . May I help you ?
Our reservation number is J - 221 .

No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault .

Sorry . I'm strictly a spectator-football , baseball , basketball , golf ... I watch them all .
Dad , I don't want to talk about it now .
I think it ' s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to London , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway .
that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk .
You forgot all of about it , didn't you ?
Thanks for your help , Ralph !
What ? Oh , what we live ! Thank you very much for your help , miss .
Hang on one second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella !
I look at many things , attendance , quizzes , and tests .
Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other .
Do you have any work experience in promotion ?
Perhaps you'd be interested in red roses .
But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things .
l am afraid there isn't any fancy soap in my room .
I would prefer next Thursday .

Well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ?
Yes , that's right . That's the poster of the The Witch .
I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ?
I only want a little off the top and the sides and back to have clean lines .
Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position ?
If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final .
Sounds pretty good . What about the charge ?
Good evening , Pizza House . This is Marty speaking . May I take your order ?
Good morning , Ruth . Did I wake you up ?
Good evening , Saliva . What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? What are you doing now ?
What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ?
Excuse me . How long has it been since the business was founded ?
Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
Wouldn ' t the owners have told me about any problems ?
Yes , of course . Here it is .
I appreciate you calling and telling me that you won ' t be in class . See you next week !
Yes , that is today's sale price .
OK , got it . Is there anything else I need to know before we go ahead ?
That's all right . But could you tell me how often and how many hours I should work overtime ?
I have no idea . Maybe you can give me some advice .

It ' s easy to say , but I will try .
I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . It gives me a real sense of satisfaction . Do you enjoy cooking ?
Thank you . I appreciate the compliment .
Yeah , yeah , I know what I selected . Just gimme my money !
Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company .
If you need anything else , just let me know .
Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 .
Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ?
You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ?
How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother .
This is the best dinner I've ever had .
Well , we can still do some window shopping , can we ?
Is it anything like American football ?

It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case .
I ' m voting for the next President .
she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back .

Sure . I usually have my lunch here . The food is tasty and they offer a big variety .
I saw the Sixth Sense . I didn't know it was going to be so scary .
I didn ' t even bother to think of that .
Which anti-virus program would you recommend ?
It's there , near the mirror .
oh , I'm sorry to hear that . You can go on a holiday to cheer you up .
Good morning , Sir . Where are you going ?
I think I must report to the cops .
I ' m going to England by flight BE987 .
I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?

Did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ?

He's in bed , doctor . Can you see him , please ? He has a bad cold , too !
Totally agree . What is your solution ?
Wow , Bruce crossed the line first .
And I ' m trying to watch the game , but you ' re yapping on about your new clothes !

Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .

It must have really hurt afterwards .
Thank you , I know where that is .
We have many kinds of different purpose . I wonder whom you are buying for ?
Let me see . En .. just a minute . Here it is . I need your signature on this note .

How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn .
It ' s right under you ! Kathy ! ! !
This is highway robbery . I've got a good mind to call the police !
Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ?
Actually , you cannot mail it in early , as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date .
Oh , I'm sorry . However , if you could help me out , I'll double the pay for the hours worked .
Excuse me , waiter , I would like to have some wine before the main course .
I'll have ham and egg with French fries . What dessert do you want ?
I have the same idea as yours .
No , but my little brother likes it very much .

OK . Do you think I can play football tomorrow ?
Are you sure he really got the message ?
The Johnson are on their way back . You remember them , don't you ?

And the holdall has some fragile items inside , so please be careful with that too .
Yes . Now I've got it . Thank you very much .

I remember that . It was a great movie . But it was definitely scary .
Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ?
May I have a look at that vase , please ?
I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman .
I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone . Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?
Cafe au lait , cafe latte , cappuccino , cafe mocha ... I can't keep them all straight !

That's over on Callaway Street , isn't it ?
I really wanted to get into NYU .
No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ?
Good , happy birthday to you !
Only one . In this case , I have a camera .
It depends on traffic and distance , but it is reasonable .
Thank you . Are all these yours ?
From a sweet ma ? ! It's not worth it . Plus , I'd happily pay more for these things I bought !
I don't know . I don't know too much about flowers . Can you recommend something ?
We have a double room for you with a nice view of the park . Would that be OK ?
I'm ask for a pizza , please .

I prefer potatoes to eggplants .
But isn't it served with cold milk ?
Wow ! How often do you exercise like that ?
Hey , look , there is a circus show over there .
Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills .
Well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers .
Let's make sure we are on the same page . Do we want a formal or informal gathering ?
All right , Maria . I ' ll give you until tomorrow at 4:00 to produce a satisfactory piece of work , but otherwise , you ' ll have to re-do it .

Hello , is this the ABC company ?
Did you have the watch before getting the ring ?
you mean if they catch the murderer . I ' m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
I think you're being a little naive .
Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ' t you ?
Good morning , can I help you ?
Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ?
So , I can have five for five dollars ?

I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring .

I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldn't fall asleep , because Brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me .

What kind of flowers would you like ?
I'm going to dinner with my family .
Would you come with me to look at apartments ?
Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one .
You probably won't have to wait for anyone , sir .
I am not sure if I will be home later .
I wonder if I can see your mother , little boy . Is she engaged ?

I'm going to the hospital to see Susan .
Thank you . I ' m leaving tomorrow morning .
It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one .
Wait a minute ! It also says that the Christ Re-deemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders . I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator !
Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .
Would you come to spend the weekend with us ?
Please fill in the arrival card and sign the register .

Well , I really wanted to see the football game .
I'm interested in Chinese antiques .
Oh , yeah . I forgot tax . Give me four then , please .
Your throat is inflamed . And your tongue is heavily coated . You have all the symptoms of influenza .
I'm not sure . I don't know very much about the price of pearls .
May I have a look at the introduction ?
He didn't even make it out the door .
I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much .

Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow here ?
Do you have a table for four , please ?

No , honey , why didn't you go to cram school last night ?
You did ? Wow ! Where did you learn ...
Take a seat inside and see what you think . So you will take the Porsche then , sir ?
The weather has been terrible this week .
You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order .
That sucks so much . What are we going to do ?
Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places .

No , not yet . I ' m still looking . I ' Ve been doing some work through a temp-agency though .
How are your typing and shorthand skills ?
once in a while , I suppose , I usually rent movies at Movie Salon .
Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost .
but it looks good . Let me try it on .
Hello , Mr . Black , how are you ?
May I see your passport , please ?
Margaret , do you think I should enroll in the science course ?
What do you mean ? We ' re talking now , aren't we ?
Of course not . I just thought the movie was ... boring .

Certainly , I can can help you with that . What type of account would you like to open ? A chequing or a savings account ?
The apples are 30NT each . How many would you like ?
Oh , it's a reserved opera named The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven .

Then I have to call another taxi , or I'll be late .
Hello . I need to find out if a Receipt of Proceeds has arrived . I'm from Felix Wasserman Associates .
Let's have a look at the menu . Oh , there isn't a menu . Do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ?
Yes , I do , Susan . Just a moment . Here it is .
Bob ! I hear your team won the match .
Yes and I've written him a letter .
Mike , I don't think that it's a good idea to go out again . I really need to focus on getting packed and ready to move back home .
Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ?
Yes , I'd like to check out now . My name's Adams , room 312 . Here's the key .
That's the reason it was such a great game .
Please ! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs .
Hello , ma ' am , can I help you find something ?
Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls .
I found it very disappointing .
Oh , I see . You're going to wear one and pretend you're married to try to attract guys .
No , I ' m afraid not , Mary . May I take a message for her ?
I'm going to spend some time exploring the city . What can I do with my luggage ?
It ' s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
Does the class start again , Mam ?
You should have been there . It was intense .
Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me !
Do you understand any other foreign languages besides English ?
I've a driver mate in my car !
Well , I worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays .
This is the Bell Captain's Desk . May I help you ?
Well , that's what I'm looking for myself .
Oh . I am not a wall streeter . Give me an economy one please .
We have new room rates , sir . Will that be acceptable to you ?
It's nice to meet you , Mr . Cooper .
Stupid girl , making me spend so much money , now I have to get it from the ATM ...
Hell , I don't care . Just don'T submit a report to your insurancecompany .
I was thinking that I would like to see " The Secret Life of Bees . "
Stay around for a while . The party is warming up .

Until next weekend . that ' s ok .

Nothing really , why , what ' s up ?
Hey , could you help me try and figure out how to get ready for my job interview ?
I often do , but I ' m worried about the responses from other people .
Sure . And I'd like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor's .
Open your mouth and show me your tongue . Say ah ... You have a bad cold . So you must stay in bed for a week .
I'm sorry . I didn't follow you . Could you please repeat that ?

Let me try it on . I like that color .

Are you ready to go to the mall ?
I'd like to have some more . It's really good .
I am sorry . If you have here more than 24 hours between connecting flights , we can't check your luggage through London .
Mexican , Japanese or Chinese would be great .
That's true . Well , how much do you think I should get ?
How come it is slow as a snail today ?
So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
Good morning , I have an appointment with Mr . Johnson at 10:00
What do you mean ? It's a scrim .
Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway .
Well . I shouldn ' t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ?

No , thanks . A taxi is just fine .

Yes , that would be great . How much is the room ?
Today is June 18 , isn ' t it ?
It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 .
Of course . Please wait a moment . I'll go and get it .
No , I didn't . I'm sorry . It won't happen again .
Well , I almost always get up very early , and I lift weights for an hour .
Man , I'm hungry . Do you know a good place to have lunch ?
Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ?
Yes , usually it takes a short time , but you have to await the choice of the units for a while .
I prefer potatoes to eggplants .
I can handle them without any trouble
I appreciate the building so much . I am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .
I'd like to start this interview with some questions . Why do you think you are qualified for this position ?
Ok . What do you think about our living room ?
You ' re not going to get it .
Do you have anything to do after this ?
I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .

I've been packed for a week . All my stuff is in this backpack .
I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game !

No problem . Now , do you prefer working with others or flying solo ?
I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .
Sure . It's to raise money for the homeless .
Well , they're for your wife , so I think you should give her roses .
When I have confirmed the times with the owners , I will e-mail you our plans for the day .
Oh . This is Paul . When will he be back ?
Mr . Smith , I's like to ask you a question .
What other sources of energy do you use ?
How about we go eat in the cafeteria ?
A little bit . I'll take a look if you want me to .
Oh , yes . How do you do , Miss Wang ? Sit down , please .
You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ' t that strict ?
well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home .
Ok , then we can sign up for it together .
What date would you like to fly ?
Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them .
I appreciate you helping me with this .
It's our pleasure to have you here . I hope you will have a pleasant stay here .
Well , yes , we are , madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes .
Let me take your blood pressure . You look anilic . Well , Mr . Brown . I ' m happy to say it ' s nothing serious . You just a little run down from overwork .
Well , thanks for the compliment anyway !
Did you go to the concert last weekend ?
I also want to pack up my package . This is the notes .
Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising .
I ' m taking BA fright 123 to London . Can you tell me where the reporting desk is , please ?
I don't buy your story . Try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ?
Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
Whew ! That getup is terrific !
Then I'll see you in the afternoon .
That's because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably .
15mins before the plane takes off . The plane is scheduled to leave on time .
You're not looking happy . What's the matter ?

I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today .
Did you pack this bag yourself ? Has it been out of your possession at any time before checking-in ?
But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too .
Not at all . You can find most of them in supermarkets . The ingredients are usually the same as in Western food . The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients .
Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey .
Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car .
Do you want me to show you where I found them ?
To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it .
Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .
Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate .
My appointment was on Monday .
You haven't ? They have a lot of good stuff .
All right , I ' ll leave her the message , Mary . Thanks for calling .
I ' m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other .
And what date will you be returning ?
I am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here .
Do you really have to work today ?
What's wrong , honey ? Take it easy .
You know that ? Joan has got the scholarship .
That's because Americans love sitcoms .
It has been 12 years since it was founded in 1998 .
Just look around ? Nah , that ' s boring .
Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of your computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thoughts .
Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ?
What other kind of music do you listen to ?
Well I think I can afford that apartment . But are pets allowed ?
Oh , I ' Ve already seen it . I saw it on television last year . It ' s an old film , but it ' s very good .
They are keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year .
Do you think Tom will be elected president ?
Then when will I get a reply at the latest ?
We're sorry that this has happened , and I guarantee that the same mistake won't happen again .
What about your use of raw materials ?
Of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . As soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed .
Well , as far as I can tell , we qualify .
I don't know . But I have a carsickness .
Actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . In the evening , many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day .
I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .
Would you like your bags to be taken to your room ?
Zach , what's that on your arm ?
I need help using the washer and dryer .
No , I don't suppose he's to blame . The man in the other car made a mistake .
No . Why don't you check out the newspaper ?
So Dick , how about getting some coffee for tonight ?
I can't . I am really behind of my work .
It's nothing serious . But I always have a headache , and I haven't slept properly for several weeks . I've also lost appetite and my eyes are burning .
What can wearing one do for me ?
We'd better not move him . I'll get the first-aider .
All right . No problem . What ' s your extension ?
ok , where and when should I meet you ?
You came to the right place . Any particular decade ?
It really must be an exciting time for you guys .
Well , that's kind of obvious .
The information is scanty for me . And can you describe the responsibilities of the position ?
No time to worry . We have to dispose of this evidence .
I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital .
The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . If I want to make in marking in advertising industry , I can ' t stop studying and creating .
Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side .
I ' d be afraid to jump from that height !

I , I don't know how to explain it to you .
Do you have a special restaurant in mind ?
We're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax .
yes , you can find almost all new releases there .
Besides , Internet tends to be more essential now in the information age .
Well , I'd like to , but I am not sure I have time .
How are you getting along with your business ?
It's said that John's broken up .
Yes , I know and I like it very much . I will take it .
By the way , what's the time ?
I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario . Then , I set a timetable that's realistic . What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react .
What do you think our chance are in other events .
Then our entire job could be done by telecommuting .
Oh , they're both so beautiful . Let me have this one , I think .
Just relax . With me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine !
What do you think ? I ' m a good boy .
I think it ' s too expensive . I can just give you 4 yuan . Or I ' ll go to another B .
Exactly . How much do you want for them ?
That's what I want ! Do you need me to sign anything ? Or fill in some forms ?
Come on , don ' t be so dramatic ! I ' m sure everything is going to work out just fine .
What are your salary expectations ?
But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas . I ' d really hate to have to take it down .
That ' s great . You ' re a lifesaver .
I think Yoga might be suitable for me .
Brian , do you know how to speak English ?
No , we didn ' t . I guess you ' re right . We should patch things up .
You could try the ravioli . They are rather like your Chinese dumplings , and the sauce is delicious .
I don't think so . But it could've been .
Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ?
I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas .
Here are some . They ' re on special sale these days .
It sure is ! The water looks so nice ! Anchor the boat for a little while . I ' m going to take a dip .
Is there a mirror around here ?
Perfect choice . For music , should we have a live band or a DJ ?
Sellers aren ' t always truthful , and there might also be problems that they aren ' t aware of .
That ' s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ' Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one !
I suppose I don't want that one then . I don't like auto-reverse . It breaks too easily .
Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later .
Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal .

Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well .
Are you sure ? I thought I said it was my mother .
Excuse me , does this bus go to the new bookstore ?
I know a shop selling this kind of sweaters .
Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately .
Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ?
You know what , I have to pick something up at the mall , so why don ' t you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries .
Would you please show me the necklace in the window ?
May I see your ticket please ?
OK . Come back into the classroom , class .
I find that you spend little on handset charge every month . Have you any trick ?
I think so . Yes , they get along so well .
Well , they ' re not here . They are in the dustbin .
What was your major in school ?
What have you learned from jobs you have held ?
Well , the wrong information is in my file . I was at a concert Monday night .
Oh , right . You ' re busy with that contract . Maybe you could join us later ?
Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities .
Great . I'll stop by your place now .
You'll never guess what I won at work today ! - Tickets to tonight's final NBA game .
I have to pay 25 cents a day ?
hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world .
And how many pieces did you have ?
Oh , yes , please . But you are just closing , aren't you ?
It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them .
Hi , I need to copy something right now .
Lucy , I ' d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ?
You need a holiday . That's what's the matter .
I ' m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off .
Would you care for some lemon for your tea ?
Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too .
We have just arrived from Tokyo only ... looking for a reserve car of your company . All of above , we cannot find it .
The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !
Hi , Monica , how is everything going ?
Yes , maybe it does . But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?
Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time .
All right , can I have your passbook ?
Get out of my store , you jerk !
Yes , and I also have the runs
Thank you . You ' Ve been very helpful .
It's $ 20 . If you are staying for more than 3 days in the city , the charge is $ 16 per day .
you're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me !
I saw her yesterday . She was a little better .

Come in , come in , what can I do for you ?
I took a lot of courses , such as Philosophy , Logic , Ethics , Aesthetics , etc .

Thank you . Mmm . Can you tell me about the terrine ?
Do the drivers speak English ?
Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ' re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining .
I didn't know you liked bird-watching .
Yes , I have , Mr . Thomas . We'll pack them two dozen to one carton , and the gross weight is around 25 kilos a carton .
I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime .
Didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs ?

I need something to wash this down . Is there any juice in the fridge ?
Ah , some products are successful at home , but not be popular overseas .

Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back !
Shall we visit the Summer Palace tomorrow ?

Professor Li , do you know where to buy art supplies ?
Oh , well , I've lost some weight . And my hair is longer than before .
Yes , quite a bit . How about a game sometime ?
The boss wanted to pay Bob with stock options . But Bob didn't want to play that game again .
so , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ?
That price is perfectly acceptable .
It ' s a good thing I asked you .
This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it .
Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
I have no idea what the entertainment should be .
I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
I heard that you finished my home inspection , and I was wondering how it went .
Excuse me . Where is the way out ?
I hear that John's leading a double wife .
What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ?

That's right . I can see them in my dreams .
I need to buy some flowers for my wife .
We have two seafood pizzas . Tuna and crab .
Good morning , Passport , please .
That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month .

Pleased to meet you too , Ms . Pewless . I travel a lot every year on business , but this is my first visit to your country . I must say I have been much impressed by your friendly people .
we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger .
How long is this cell phone guaranteed ?
Two years is fine , with a value of 1,000 RIB .
that's quite expensive . Who is their target audience ?
Well , take it easy ! Don't let it get on top of you .
Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .
Is there anything worth watching on another channel ?
I've paid for it . Here's the receipt .
It sounds like you're coming down with something .
Okay , sir . But don't take too long . You only have 30 minutes .
Could you please help me to check out the book ?
Nice to meet you , Mr . Peter . I ' m Wang Sian . I ' Ve come for an interview as requested .
Well , I own a house . actually , I ' m leaving my dog there with my neighbors . I have a car at home , and oh , my job ! I ' m employed by Tornal as an engineer . Actually , I only have three weeks ' vacation , so I have to go back to work at the end of March .

Not at all . It has a very delicate flavor .
No , thanks . I will call back later .
That ' s for sure . You ' re new , too , huh ?

Sounds like we have the same idea .
How many people are on the waiting list right now ?
OK , thanks for checking . Could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ?
I liked Aesthetics best . It is very impressive .
I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-depth research before I send my application letters out .
I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ?
I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you !
I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month .
It's a long story . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up .
Well , we have all kinds of beverages in addition to fruit juices .
May son adores my new hairstyle so I suppose it is worth it .

There were a number of reasons .
Hey , May , look , Is that the the poster of the movie we saw yesterday ?
Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ' s the third quarter and you ' Ve been blabbering on since the first !
It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public .
Oh , well this one has the , uh .
It will take about thirty minutes because it is the rush hour .

What ' s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ?
I ' m sorry , Mr . Richard . Mr . Johnson is on his way to the office . He had just called and asked you to wait a minute .

Tired and stressed . This wedding is giving me a headache .
YES . I ' Ve lost quite a few pounds since last month .

Very well sir . Would you like to have some shirts made also ?
Thanks . It's rather cold this morning , wouldn't you say ?
Yes , I think I am quite proficient in both written and spoken English .
It ' s always easier to say something than to do it .
I haven't been to the Mall in a long time . Let's go there .
You don't need to introduce yourself , Yang . You're famous .
I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation .
It is in that brand new , tall building over there . On the 9th floor .
Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ' s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ?
Nothing different from a secretary's common responsibilities . However , you know , our company is an international trade-oriented company , can you handle English papers and write English correspondence ?

I agree . But I think that we can handle the problem by making a few major changes . I ' d appreciate it if you would give me a chance .
I know a very interesting place .
Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ?
We've never expected that Shanghai is such a big metropolis , same as New York city . David , would it be a good idea to rent a car here ? I've got an international driver's license with a pretty good record in the States .
I believe you have charged me twice for the same thing . Look , the figure of 6 . 5 dollar appears here , then again here .
but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .
I am trying to find a job asap . Lily doesn't know yet . I didn't tell her . I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought I went to work as usual .
Oh , so Dalian is hotter than New York now .

Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ?
When I kicked that habit , I found I had so much more energy . I started exercising .

No , I have visited China several times , but it's my first visit to Beijing and I think it's a great honor to be invited to your beautiful city .
Yeah , so are you planning on going ?
I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day .
Some game ! You try being tackled by ten kids at once !
Could I purchase Euro with RIB here ? I have to stay here for months .
How many countries have been affected ?

Why don't you try Chinese herbal medicine ?
Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy . or a kitty !

I can ' t help you with that .

But I am her brother , not her servant .
Do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
I was in New York for a wedding .
Jeff , look at this listing ! It says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent , and it's only $ 700 per month . What do you think ?
Of course . I want to buy some night cream for my mom , and some masques for myself .
Really ? How did you get the chance ?
I was wondering if you could help me with something .
I wish I had a chance to see it with my own eyes .
Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses .
the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland .
Shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ?
Yes . It will be fun . Driving back down the coast . My girlfriend will like it .
I will be there half an hour early .
What can I do for you , young man ?
But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ?

Yeah , I broke up with Lisa . She blew a gasket over it . Whoa , get a load of that !
And I've got to drive . You know I'm not fond of that . I found it much more relaxing to sit in the train .
Well , I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but I don ' t really care for curtains . Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient .
Yes . I have to stay in your cry for just one day , can you suggest a short tour ?
That sounds great . Where are you going ?
There ' s no way that I can stay here .
Have you found anything nice yet ?
congratulations ! I had no idea .
What about the hotel accommodations ?
I'd like to order breakfast , please .
Never mind being sorry , what are you going to do about it ?
I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ' t pay much attention in art class at school .
You'll need to make an appointment .
My plans are to be there April 14th to the 17th .
Where did you spend your holiday ?
My children can never be obedient even if I criticized them severely .

OK . This key is too high for me .
Oh , don't mention it . It was terrible .
I have a concussion , but I will be OK .
But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance .

You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ?
Yeah , some places are very short of water .
What do you think of the local accent here ? Has it been causing you any problems ?
why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that .
First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract .
Thank you for your inition . I'm free tonight .
Yeah . All of us tried our best .

Oh ! You took the guesswork right out of that one .
OK , do you know the title of the book ?
Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure .
Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ?
First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations .
If that information is exact , I guess our company is willing to promote someone .
What type of position are you looking for ?
Sorry , I am not sure . Can I take a message ?

I am really interested in buying this television .
There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room .

I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ?
Sure you have to be patient . But I think it ' s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls .
it'll be sad to see you go , but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity .
If boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad .
Then what ' s your counter-offer ?
Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night .
I enjoy the various characters and the plot .
But very much quicker . But I know we'll never agree on this subject . You prefer the car . I prefer the train .

Thank you for saying so . Have you seen the exhibition halls ? On display are most of our products , such as silk , woolen knitwear , cotton piece goods , and garments .
I have a complaint to make . The bill you sent me was incorrect . What's more , it isn't the first time
Yes , it's been marvelous . It really was very kind of you to invite me . I hope it hasn't been too much trouble .
Not yet , but I'm thinking of it . Have you bought one , Dad ?
Lower level employees need not attend . The purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat .

I ' m ready and willing to help .
No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ?
Where is the school cafeteria ?
I don't want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals .
I am going to invite other guys . See you that day .
It must have taught you a lesson this time .
Oh no you didn ' t . You didn ' t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ' t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans .
Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ?
I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription .
Yeah , almost . But there is one thing .
Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere .
Yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough .
Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio .

No , sir . That's only with the very big companies . I'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot .
I'm not really accustomed to the style of the new boss .
Oh , cheer up . He ' ll understand you .
But he seems to be very happy with Rose .
Well , since you have come , do it now please ?
OK . You ' d better come back in two hours .
Let's go into the restaurant and find a table to order some food .
Not really . I ' d really like to try golf , though .

What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense .
Which team do you think will win ?
I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
I think Beethoven's music is incredible . I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . Do you believe that ?
not at all , but we don ' t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly !
Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat .

A shouting match ? You ' re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ' t believe it .

Okay , thin crust . Your total is $ 21 . 50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ' s free !
But it ' s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches .
All right . See you tomorrow night .
Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over .
My prize was for the best player in the country . Now let's start playing chess seriously .
The most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides . Do you know all about them ?
It is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell China .
Well , could you change them too ? The dollars , I want to change them into Swiss francs .
You would be using mainly English in this job . Do you think you could manage ?
Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
Working in the gym is a very good way for losing weight . What else do you have ?
Excellent ! That sounds like a plan .
If it breaks down , maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet .
Good morning . Thank you for the interview .
Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ?
Fine , thank you . I haven ' t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ?
Thank you ! Would you like an aisle seat or a window seat ?
Now he only works freelance . Hundred bucks an hour .
I'd like a flower-and-bird painting .
Yes . Bring me a bath towel as well .
What happens if I can ' t leave on April 13 ? Can I cancel my ticket or change the reservation to another date ?
Not great . It's a kind of boring .
Oh , yes . It ' s and excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
OK , so here ' s the plan ; When we land , run to gate 14 !
They ' ll do the operation for you this Friday .
Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ?
I've no idea . Oh yes , and the most ridiculous thing . He asked me what I had for breakfast this morning .
I wrote the check out for way too much .
Yes , at the end of the hall .
But he's equally responsible because he tried to overtake you .
Sure . I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores .
Oh no ! I forgot about those too ! Those are Chinese sausages for my Aunt Lily .
Let me see . I am sorry we just have sold it out .
Thank you so much for all of the information .
A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ?
He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .
No problem . I'll wait for your call .
No , no way ! What happened ? Give me my money !
Yes , most of the time . But , sometimes things can get difficult .
Yes , I never seem to have any energy .
Good morning ! Welcome to our office !
Are you busy tomorrow morning ?
You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different .
Great . What types of things will we do at Lushun Falls ?
Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry .
Yes , sir . I acted as a secretary in an insurance company .
I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it !
How are your typing and shorthand skills ?
Do you have a medium in the same color ? This one is a little tight .
I guess you get what you pay for .
Yes , I have two brothers who live in New York and a sister who lives in Boston .
This is Rachel in Human Resources . I need two boxes of company letterhead , one box of ball-point pens , and a box of envelopes .
Good afternoon , how may I help you ?
( Handing her a menu ) Your waiter will be here in a minute to take your order .
But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans .
What do you like to do in your spare time ?
I am sure you can do better than that .
Can I require the owners to fix the problems ?
Correct . Now for a harder question . Who will be the first men on Mars ?
It's got to be almost a year now .
I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
I don ' t think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking .
We like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music .
Of course it does ! They tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house . I think most of the times they are just scam artists .
Now , I'd like to get things under way . The main topic on today's agenda is the development of a U . S . sales strategy for the new EBB . I'd like to hear all of your ideas , Mr . Wall , you seem in top form today . Could you start the ball rolling ?
No , seriously . I am impressed .
Nice to meet you here . How come you dropped into this company today ?
Uh-oh . We don't have a flashlight .
Sarah , what did you do today ?
Have I used the one that my sister is sick ?
Here's a twenty . Could you give me some more napkins ?
Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ?
Four is an unlucky number here , Peter . Four sounds like death in Chinese . Hotels often have no fourth floor .
Look , how grand magnificent the Tiananmen Gate tour is !
Do you already know how to play an instrument ?
That's great . Can I book the room ?
people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated .
I certainly do . Here it is , an Export L / C from Tokyo .
It ' s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits .
A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood .
Don ' t worry . That ' s just a part of being a teenager .
Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes will do no good .
Have you ever read this book before ?
Just point to it if you don't know the name .
the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ' t be sure how .

There are websites that can hook you up with a roommate .
I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them .

I see . It must be worth going to .
What courses did you take in college ?
That's it . I decided to turn over a new leaf . I'm going to exercise every single day .
Yes . And it was incorporated with other businesses in 2008 due to the global financial crisis .
Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .
That ' s right . Plus , I agree with his policies .
It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
OK . The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan . On that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river .
We have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales .
Yeah , I'm worried . If it's like this tomorrow , our big outdoor party will have to be canceled .
I think I might've bumped into her before .
Lucky you ! I can't buy anything else . I'm flat broke .
Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .
That's a long time . Where did she live before that ?
Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
Thanks . I'll get back to you .
Can I have an aisle seat , PLS .
Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class .
You mean we'll share the taxi ?
Have you a pattern in your mind ?
En ... it tastes good . I appreciate what you have done for me .
How time flies ! I'll not see twenty again .
Is it too late to mail the Continued Claim Form in now ?
Yes , I've been observing them .
Me ? No way , keep him away from me , please .
He's away on a business trip . He won't be back until some time next week .
Just make yourself at home . The other guests should be arriving shortly .
So I don't have to worry about them .
Steven , I'm going abroad by plane for the first time tomorrow . Can you give me some advice ? And what should I pay attention to ?
I'd like to talk to somebody about the Group Account Deposit Service .
Yes , they were . But it has already past . The traffic from the airport to downtown has been relieved after the completion of Yan'an Aerial Road .
What would the roses cost me ?
So , are you going to go to class tonight ?
thanks a lot . You ' Ve been very helpful .
Sure , I ' ll just go put the kettle on . Why don ' t you have a seat on the sofa and I ' ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
Would you like to ask me anything ?
So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ?
Here is a present for you . I hope you like it .
Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful .
Why ? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands ?
It's a good thing that I have choices here . Can you tell me about the one on Saturday ?
Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?
Reservation , can I help you ?
All right . Which room shall I have ?
Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see .
has the government taken some measures to curb it ?
Room service . What can I do for you ?
I'm crazy about it . It makes me very excited .
Actually , I'd like a booth by the window if that's possible .
Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ?
Excuse me . Do you know where the Admiral Hotel is ?
What do you mean ? If he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in .
Did you ever talk to him about it ?
Yes . When can I get them back ?
What am I supposed to do then ?
Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .
